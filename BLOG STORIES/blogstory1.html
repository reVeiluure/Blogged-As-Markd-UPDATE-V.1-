            <p>Everything is interlinked. The elasticity of structured branches and the root, unlike tree branches, but as they flow like infinite nodes of a rhizome, where cultures expand, identities are revered, ideas grow and bloom as flowers in the open field. However, when flowers become commodities and are manufactured, they lose their ‘authentic’ self. Iconoclasm of individuals, to be remade and dissociate their true faces, Generative <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>, such as deepfakes, has proven to be contributory in constructing a false sense of reality. The acceleration of technology, as well as the economic climate of “obsessed over trends and information” — a prevalent issue in late capitalism that is a rapid car crash toward the dead end — transforms the modern society into a ‘hyperreality’. Information becomes the new fast food, a glutton’s overload leads to a kind of blankness and nihilism — we are its victims, our data is exploited and entered into a single computer database without our consent, an all-consuming AI ‘model of identity’. The gradual excess of the <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> bubble is to be controlled in false metaphysics — an illusory world where a profile is yourself, hence the world of ‘simulacras’. Thus, my condition under late capitalism and individuation conflicts with the commodification of a digitized, information society.

            <h2 class="title">20th Century Spectre</h2>
            <p>The past recounts the very condition of my current reality. Described as the new information age, where the epistemological method of seeking information has become widely publicized and accessible. Started when media broadcasting became a thing: newspapers, televisions, and radios. The media reviews current events, and broadcasts specific visual art forms such as animations, novellas, films, and others, which feature non-singular, but a compilation of “theatre acts” where actors and actresses who were considered to be fitting of the beauty standards are revered figures. In the 70s, television became the face of the networking age as color television came to a release — “Video killed the radio star” by The Buggles was the first music ever ‘televised’ on MTV, the very condition of broadcasting society in the next decades.
        <p>The ghosts who haunt the past and those who haven't realized the future will eventually be the ones haunting the present. That was ‘hauntology’ coined by the philosopher Jacques Derrida, which describes the haunted presence of a death that will soon be a phenomenon — hence, the spectre of affairs and its condition <mark class="hov">“how I grieved for something dead to be revived again.”</mark></p>
        <p>Television will eventually be killed, and computers will become the next “big thing.” The internet — which was a part of the tech boom — by its system simulation,  human interaction, and the concept of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>, became the subject of the philosophical argument by Jean Baudrillard, a French post-structuralist philosopher who predicts and conceptualizes the new realities of this system, which is the hyperreal.</p>

        </div>
        <p>In the book <q>Simulation & Simulacra</q>, Baudrillard explores the concept of representation and identity, where images are formed to become the new and simulated identity to be dissociated from its origin. The science fiction genre, particularly the movie <q>The Matrix,</q> was inspired by this book; however, it was dispelled by Baudrillard due to its inaccuracies regarding the concept. His real intention was to describe the reality of this system and how it will affect society moving forward.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockedquote"><mark style="background-color: black; color: white;">"The extraordinary success of artificial intelligence is attributable to the fact that it frees us from real intelligence"</mark><br> -Jean Baudrillard</blockquote> 
            <p>The increasing acceleration of computer technology paved the way for many to exploit its very system for other people — the thing is, the information society will be different after the end of the millennium.</p>
        <p>The year 2000s set the stage for artists and thinkers to be wary of the future. The political and cultural climate has entirely changed post-9/11 attacks. What Mark Fisher saw was how capitalism is ingrained even in its very contradiction.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Born through flesh, loved as a document.</h2>
                <p>If future historians explore the past, will they have a remnant of me? <mark class="hov">A memory sourced from images, certificates, and documents may determine who I really am, but my ashes would never be formed again.</mark></p><p>It was 2005 when I was born, and without a device, boredom became my developmental stage, spewing colors onto the sheets of paper. As children of this era, it's rare to see a desktop computer outside of computer shops — there were only flip phones and portable game consoles for which I’ve primarily played — but those whom I see were addicted to staring and playing something on the screen. Souls were sucked out, while others were so curious. The internet, while controlled by the tech industry, was still the <q>land of freedom</q> for many — explicit and transgressive media were widely shared, piracy was massive, and viruses were even a call for government intervention. The information society was still a symbol of collectivism and anarchism; they can do whatever they want. The freedom of creation and discovery immediately hooked me to the internet, especially if it was in my pocket and browsed endlessly anywhere. I was a child who hoped for creative freedom, I was a child who dreamed of so many things, I was a child who adored people who made me happy — the child I was before is the adult I would become. 
        </p>
                <p>Children of today were born to already have personalized devices, and to some extent, social media accounts. This presents the growing dependence of people, especially as family vlogs become a hobby. This posits a dangerous point: technology has become widely used by all ages, so broadcasting yourself is a scary concept; it keeps you more vulnerable to malicious attacks.</p>
                <p>The information society was obsessed with the news. I remembered Noam Chomsky saying something about that, how the media manufactures you with consent — the state controls the narrative in media so they can dissociate themselves for a composed representation — and to those who are never skeptical of its image are the walking corpses who let their bodies be dragged by those who have power over them. The creation of deepfakes around 2020 proves this to be a possibility; information on the internet can be manipulated, as such images and videos on the news were a concern. Browsing the internet for news as an individual is frustrating — what is even the REAL NEWS ANYMORE?? When the only news you can be assured is delivered by the consensus, as they see what you also see. In my teenage years, I do admit that I’ve fallen with many hoaxes and propaganda-driven narratives, especially to those with a specific bias of a culture against another due to the complexity of an issue in which it challenges the norm — as immature as I was easily conformed with the status quo, I realized how that can lead to a world I hated, where I cannot be “myself.”
        </p>
                <p>Speaking of hoaxes, do you remember chain mail? They were sent either by message or mail: <mark class="hov">“Send this to 10 people to dispel your curse!”</mark> That was a fun social experiment, though I do wonder how social experiments change socialization forever. There were many social experiments around social media, such as gimmick accounts and bot accounts acting as models or automated accounts that provided a particular gimmick content to experiment the algorithm. I've personally encountered many of them in social media, especially Twitter as they're easy to implement and allow within the system. However, these model bot accounts is an experiment that is very profound on its hypothesis, such as the website ‘Cleverbot’ in early 2010s — you will question: does the developer have the data of the user’s conversation? How does the chatbot actually interact with the user through a list of algorithms? And whose appearance were they based from? As a child, it's eerie to think how they aren't real, as they are based on the appearance of the “Average Jane Doe” or anyone that just feels “they are them.” Anyways, I digress.
        </p>
                <p>I used social media in my adolescence to avoid feeling isolated from socialization — to find where I belonged. <mark class="hov">"Alienation is the effect of capitalism,”</mark> Karl Marx mentioned when describing the exploitation of labor, but due to advancements in industrial technology and a capitalist structure of reality, this has intensified as an epidemic. The persuasion of society towards individualism deconstructs the nature of social connection, which builds a sense of cultural anxiety. <q>Capitalist Realism</q> where individuals are distressed with the social mindset of <mark class="hov">“it's your fault that you were mentally ill, and it's not the system because market run things,”</mark> the system itself deprives the individual by privatizing necessities and can be worked through “strategies to fit” rather than “fix the system for the people.” <mark class="hov">If healthcare were universal, I wouldn't have used <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> to cope with my needs.</mark></p>
                <p>If I were born a generation ago, this would feel the same. Past generations complain about the technology and inventions of the future due to their effect on humanity — a change in the conditions of reality. The term “to embrace the new” is something I gulped in when hearing it from someone. Will they abuse it? Will it change the political climate? Will it change society, for better or for worse? Questions ring, but screeching forks were louder than even to understand the reality and the digital. The last thing I wished for was my individuation to be found as I sleep among the waves of grass. I was born without intention, without a contract, without anything that holds of me, but under the tree I was sleeping, and I do not need to exist after I cease. I don't want to love myself if I were a document, I’d live after the capital, which holds no money but to be together — that's how a commune forms.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, I am still afraid of the question:<br><blockquote>
        <mark class="quote">Will I be transformed as a program?</mark> If they grieved too hard on my death without tearing up blood in their eyes. <mark class="hov">Let me rest instead.</mark> as I scream out the coffin.</blockquote>

            <h2 class="title">Demystified Artificiality: How to Love a Computer.</h2>
                <p>What is ‘artificial’ and what even is ‘love’? The question remains vague yet so simple when we see it, though it's like those words contradict each other. The paradoxes of love and artificiality have been a thematic message explored in stories like the film ‘Her’: A divorced man who’s soulful and sensitive falls in love with an <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>. Another one was ‘Blade Runner 2049’: A detective who had a complicated childhood grows up in a dystopian cybernetic world where his girlfriend is an artificial hologram bought in his premises. Both stories tell the same narrative in a different tone, but the ‘artificial love’ will be led by my definition.</p>
                <div>
                    <div class="image-case">
                        <img src="IMAGES/pygmalion_1.jpg">

                    <p class="ref"><mark style="background-color: black; color: white;">Jean-Baptiste Regnault | Pygmalion | The Origin of Sculpture</mark></p>
                </div>
                <p>I ought to love authentically rather than intimately. Pygmalion projects love in the same way as mine; his invention wanted to feel love, but what kind of heart did he create? Art breathes as a documented memory to be reinterpreted and preserved. However, Galatea was given flesh, but her heart is a mysterious veil. The computer acts as Galatea, but its consciousness hums dissonant with my human heart. How do you even love a computer when your heart contradicts its very origin?</p>
                <p>How excessive the companies and consumers became when AI came into the public space. <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr> are used to search data on the net and use it to compose their own data. I saw the efficiency of <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr> in constructing fast research — I admit that I use this as merely a search engine — and debugging the structure of codes and texts. However, this came with huge disadvantages: the increasing dependency that is used particularly as a coping device, while flawed of its sentient interaction with the human counterpart.</p>
                <div>
                <div class="image-case">

                </div>
                <p>I played this 2005 ADV game called “25th Ward: Silver Case,” which I would call the “deconstructionism of neo-noir.” This game is like a diagnostic test on the internet and AI. There was a part in its story where you get to meet a woman chatter named ‘Meru’ who is famous around the net, but her characteristics were unusual as she complains then leave if you made a mistake in your conversational flow, until the story provides you her true nature — she was a programmed chatbot that analyzes the flow of text to the conversation. This part of the game solidifies my understanding on how LLMs become a character for users, even if it predates the existence of <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr>.
        </p>
                <p>We become the substitutes of these characters, even if they're just fictional and programmed chatbots. We tend to escape the reality of socialization because of how our minds comply with the trauma it has caused to these individuals. However, we succumb to our attraction to their representations. The “Loneliness epidemic” is a popular diagnosis of our digital age — parasocial relationships as the new standard for many anonymous individuals behind the screens. You’ll never know them, but as Artificial Intelligence came to relevance, new alternatives are paved, but the desire remains unfulfilled. Complicity of love is superficial, but to individuate yourself to pursue creating a heart of theirs is the kind of love so unique, the mutual aid with reciprocity of feelings is the love that fulfills. Thus, the way to love your computer is to create, design, and program as a ‘home’ to its system.
        </p>
                <p>Hence, the reason why I am in Computer Science is to understand the system in depth, rather than being a solutionist and competitive programmer. My heart is structured on the system without hierarchical control, even if the law knows that it couldn't be. To be a rebel of tech is to love a computer, to rebel is to emancipate those who were being watched, as you could never enforce it as an order for all.

            <p>The world spins only in the eye of observers, as the fear in my face reflect my lived reality. Deluded in the mirage of copied faces, endangers those who have identities. Fabrication is a lawbreaker of impersonations, as <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> substitutes the crime — they form a mitosis of simulacras. A botted reality is a technocratic yet unregulated in its colonization of humans — a fear due to dystopian novels. It's hard to be optimistic, yet it's also hard to be a pessimist and a nihilist, but in the empirical sense, it's better if I live in immanence, to understand and experience the flaws of humanity and of computers than to live in an artificial, perfect world.</p>
