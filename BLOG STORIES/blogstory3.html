        <h2 class="title">TO DREAM A HEART</h2>
        <p>Every night, I yearn for something, and that is the meaning and will to love. I want to learn and experience everything without external forces conditioning me from within. There is a certain curiosity that is brewing in our hearts, burnt and carved if we push ourselves to learn. It hurts how every resurrection after infinite burnouts tear the remaining energy of creating that thing I desire. However, I am a person who cares too deeply, and as systems in our bodies, words, identities, and environments are things I want to learn and preserve. In the digitized society, what do I desire when I want to love my computer — that is, to compose systems where the creative mind is intimate with re-organizing abstract concepts into visual or audio art. In order to create is to achieve the ability to create, thus what I yearn for is to scientifically experiment with a post-humanist approach.</p>

        <h2 class="title">SYSTEM DESIGN AS A DREAM CAREER</h2>
        <p>A dream career that I’ve been wanting to pursue is Multimedia. I’ve had a huge interest in films, music, and painting that there’s a certain point in my college life where I wanted to shift into a Multimedia course. One of my New Year’s Resolutions for 2026 is to focus on Multimedia designs — I had an amateur experience when it comes to designing interfaces, but my experiences on different hobbies help to learn perspectives, color distinctions, and layouts. </p>
        <p>Photography, which is the hobby I am most well-known and experienced in. Starting from Senior High School as I was incredibly lost and depressed without a clear goal ahead, and it was the hobby that shaped that there is still meaning when I create images. I studied how ISO and Shutter Speed interact with each other to capture clean or distorted images. As an artist that wanted a form of radicalization, I didn't follow the standards on photography but acted as tools by implementing an atmosphere and fragmentation — glitched colors, lines, texts — to create an unfamiliar feeling that I wasn't so aware of before. That was how I got into photoshop, it was my introduction to visual design and editing that it felt like I am drawing like a child again, but through distorting images by distinctive shapes and colors that I get to create something out of the ordinary for me.</p>
        <p>My obsession with abstract art when dissecting the exact philosophy of <b>Socrates and Plato</b>: <blockquote>“The beauty of art is the imitation (Mimesis) of reality and form.”</blockquote></p><p> I disagree with Socrates and Plato as realism became a substandard with art, treating painting as only a replica of real life — hence, it is why people are so obsessed with realism over stylistic choices. Art evolves as society progresses through post-fordist systems of manufactured products. The market is filled with art fillers that it becomes an oversaturation of art, thus many artists don't like to embrace the market but forms of expression.</p>
        <p>Through the internet, there is so much art that is accessible through the search engine. What they create and reveal is either the fictional and stylish look of brush strokes and form, hyperrealism that is obsessed with fooling the audience if it is a painting or a picture, or the visual abstraction of particular aesthetics and form. The visual abstraction is defined through mathematics and system — hence the word abstraction — however, it also presents how composing these abstract designs operate as learning devices for many other aesthetics.</p>
        <div class="image-case">

          <p class="ref"><mark style="background-color: black; color: white;">TouchDesigner</mark></p>
        </div>
        <p><b><u>Touch Designer</u></b> is one of the programs I wanted to use, only if it was free to use. This design program functions to create not only graphical designs, but systems of code to create unique visuals primarily used in live concerts and video arts. Its complexity intrigues me of using the program as a tool to create, either for commercial purposes or personal use. Still it is one of my dream visual programs aside from Blender.</p>
        <p>When I want to improve my illustration skills, there are so many applications that I can use to draw — like <b><u>Ibis Paint</u></b>, <b><u>Procreate</b></u>, or <b><u>Affinity</b></u> — these applications help me draw and sketch from imagination. I still use references and sketches to determine the exact design that I wanted, and after many tries, I could feel it is unfinished but I was satisfied. Every artwork is unfinished, even when rendered or formed, but they are still signs that much effort has been applied. No work could be ever finished, thus I turn to create the unordinary. 2D illustrations help especially if I were to create posters of media that I love and messages that I ought to express — such template patterns are scattered online and can be downloaded, it is like I’m collecting scraps on a junkyard to create something valuable. My dream is a junkyard of ideas, because it is a lottery of discovering something that’ll spark, but the progress on developing that won’t stop — creating art is endless that eats itself alive.</p>
        <p>Transitioning into 3D designs, <b><u>Blender</b></u> is one on my list to use when creating 3D models for a game, but I digress when we talk about game development. 3D Designs, when it becomes available in professional electives in 3rd Year, it would be my main choice program — as my obsession with geometry and designs would be possible when these multimedia systems are to be learned and developed.</p>

          <p class="ref"><mark style="background-color: black; color: white;">PureData | Sound Modulation | Janelle Mayo Blog</mark></p>
        </div>
          <p>Sound programming is another one I would like to explore further, but I would also want to cooperate this with visual design. Programs like <b><u>Pure Data</b></u> and <b><u>Max</b></u> are both programming languages compatible with creating such designs — think of algorithm visual diagrams when you are explaining your logic game flow, but as wired systems that create and modify data, it functions primarily to produce abstract sounds similar to electronic artists like Ryoji Ikdea, Autechre, or Aphex Twin. Such complex designs are my dream artworks, but I digress.</p>
        <p>All these systems intrigue me as a computer science student, it is difficult however that I would transition careers after finishing a course because I didn’t find myself interested and skilled. There are still so many things that I yearn of learning — it is the kind of love that I do feel intense and intimate, but this passion is yet restricted. Maybe a few years after working as a Software Developer or a job that would sustain my ability to learn design and programming that I would take a course that is most appropriate and something I feel passionate about.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, there is still a certainty that Game Development would be possibly my course of action when entering the industry. Video Games are a massive part of my life as I learned many things as I treat them more as literature than interactive entertainment. There is a story that can be composed, as well as producing visuals and sounds. Developing a game is difficult: physics, logic, graphics, shaders, and geometry are all needed when you are creating a game — it is tough especially for indie developers. In Software Engineering, it will be the testament because the project we’ve proposed is a video game and not an workbased application, we are 5 members in the group and I will be designing most of the project. Planning to manage both my hobbies, relationships, and academics are becoming much rougher due to the subject’s hustle-pressure culture. </p>
        <p>Ultimately, I am still lost while I am looking forward about my future. Wasted many precious times, but they are still the times that has benefited me the most. I am still amateur when programming, I am still amateur when designing, yet I am beyond from the first steps from the ground. There’ll be time when my skills become meaningful, and there’ll be time when it deteriorates, but 5 years from now — I couldn’t expect anything besides that I would still be pursuing what I desired.</p>

        <h2 class="title">TO DREAM IN FRAGMENTS</h2>
        <p> There is still a spirit that is burning inside me, and to dissect it is criminalizing abstraction, because the heart itself is an abstraction that cannot be defined. <b>“Abztraksyonizm”</b> is a name I would keep as a future visual artist. As a future software developer who specializes in design, understanding abstraction is like a key to loving someone who never feels comfortable being misunderstood. If I were to love a computer, abstraction would be its nature — we dissect the heart to comprehend the scientific reality it is living in. I would make my abstract computer a vigorous human, in exchange for my time. I think what it means to live is to love anything.</p>
