            <h2 class="title">ART||NOISE||ANARCHY</h2>
            <p>Art has rules, and design is stricter due to its principles. There are perspectives, styles, colors, and forms because to the intent of accessibility, but why are people becoming so entranced with breaking it? We begin to learn, and end by destabilising its very system. Personality is embedded in what we create, hence A.I. could never replicate our minds. That artistic mind is a rebel of the masses; the artists could never conform, as they express whatever they are. To be an artist is to be an anarchist; those who understand but would never follow. Everything is a mural to paint, even the paintings that have form. Noisier, brighter, disordered, the chaos star leads to infinite possibilities, and the rational noise speaks only for those who are condemned as insane, as we are all an interconnected string of collective consciousness.</p>

        <h2 class="title">History of Art Deviance</h2>
        <div>
            <p>I have a very particular liking when it comes to avant-garde. Contemporary art in the 20th Century embodied the very systems of our current society, rooting from art movements such as Expressionism from the 19th Century, the art scene became obsessed with how personalities build upon the construction of the art.</p>
            <p>Dadaism, the movement of non-conformists who defy the definition of art, hence the “Anti-Art” revolution. This is one movement that I do adore the most, as Dadaists challenge the social norms of Post-World War 1 society in the context of Futurism. Dadaism Art features a wide variety of D.I.Y. experimentation: film or photo collages, sudden cuts, irrational and absurd imagery, nonsensical poetry, and satires. Dada was considered the very root of punk and counter-culture in the context of the early 20th century.</p>
            <p>During World War 2, as working-class revolutions occurred in different parts of the world, many artists began to revolutionize the scene. Surrealist movements shared particular goals with the Communists toward human liberation — they challenge the norms by focusing on constructing dreamlike scenes that defy psychological barriers. I personally love this movement due to the psychological and dreamlike aspect, which became a staple for some of my art projects, although I didn’t like to associate Salvador Dali with his admiration for fascism. Constructivism, an avant-garde art movement that constructs the scenes of a utilitarian society under the Bolshevik’s revolution. Soviet Russia united to embrace art and diversity, whilst Nazi Germany gentrified art — they built a museum to watch “degrading art” which is filled with abstract art, and another museum for “appropriate art” which is filled with neoclassical and impressionist art.</p>
            <p>World War 2 destroyed a lot of art, and some were not preserved, but manufactured copies instead. Post-War horrors came with stronger voices in the counter-culture and the avant-garde; Abstract Expressionism forming a new style that embraces actions of painting rather than the painting itself, New Wave films that explores social themes becoming prevalent, as Japanese Filmmaking and Photography movements also started to be the deviance themselves with aggression and surreal scenes that was inspired by Dadaism, and music gradually turns into a “rock & rebellion” as Garage Rock and Art or Experimental Rock revolutionize the landscape of rock. These are all responses to the trauma of the global world. Hippies became prominent in expressing love and peace, but ended with violence and government intervention. The world has come to a different time with each decade.</p>
            <p>One thing to be considered, society has progressed towards a post-structural world, where social cultures and politics drive as elastic threads in a fluid environment. Derrida described this unstable chain of meaning and significance as a “différance” where meaning is everywhere, but Deleuze and Guattari described this as the interconnectedness of everything by “deterritorializing” the culture — hence the non-hierarchical structure of society, which is the rhizomatic flow of reality. We need to consider this as it was the very root of my epistemic reality where I discovered that life is an endless cycle of possibilities, every moment in our lives has a connection to the past, present, and future — in short, anarchism is ontological, and my own personal discipline to live in solidarity.</p>
            <p>The avant-garde has always meant to defy social consciousness by incorporating abstraction. I think that’s what really makes transcension and immanence interplay so well, that is, the rebellion to explore humanity much deeper and empirically — the fulfillment of our shells, and the creation of endless possibilities — that is how the chaos star metamorphoses.</p>

            <h2 class="title">MUSIC // INDUSTRIALIZED: <u>POST-HUMANISTS' WAY OF LOVE</u></h2>
            <p>There is this thing that fascinates me about Industrial Music, and that is the unusual yet aggressive sound that becomes a spark of the statement: <blockquote> “Everything can be music, as long as it is created by a human.”</blockquote></p>
            <p>Industrial Music is an umbrella of genres that contain mechanical instruments. Ranging from droning landscapes and noisy, metallic, heavy drums, one can assume how diverse the genre can be. Personally, I am sensitive to screeching sounds like forks on a plate, but when mixed into music theory, there is such beauty to experience — it's how the rawness of a meat can be cooked. This escape from comfort zones through my transgression against my mental boundaries, discovers new feelings that were inside my unconscious mind.</p>
            <p>The movement started as the experimentation from different artists such as Wim Nijenhuis, who released a 3-track single “Rekengeluiden van PASCAL” that engineered a set of data sounds and created a noise so abstract that it glitches outside the speakers. Popular art rock outfit “The Velvet Underground” has also begun to experiment with noise in rock, as Lou Reed pioneered the 60s-70s noise and drone scene, incorporating sampled music under droning noise. This is later accompanied by artists such as Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, Chrome, and Nurse With Wound, which evolve the genre into diverse sounds.

            <p class="ref"><mark style="background-color: black; color: white;">Einstürzende Neubauten</mark></p>
        </div>
        <p>One of my favorite acts in the ‘80s industrial music wave is Einstürzende Neubauten, this German industrial band headed by Blixa Bergeld incorporate the most unusual instruments — the industrial debris of sound recorded by powered drills, gas canisters, sheet metal, pipes, and custom-built instruments found in junkyards — with his dark yet powerful voice and the chorals which builds an atmosphere so oppressive like the wind pushing your lungs as you inhale the chemicals.</p>
        <p>During the late ‘80s and ‘90s, Industrial Rock and Metal entered the mainstream as they got a place on billboards and Grammys due to MTV and marketing — that was the band Nine Inch Nails. The explosive performances brought by the extremes of Trent Reznor with dark and abrasive synths, groovy synth drums, and atmosphere inspired by <abbr title="Electric Body Movement">EBM</abbr> wave of the ‘80s. In its prime, Ministry became that Industrial Metal band of the era with their strong political messaging and post-humanist imagery — they consider themselves as the Anarchist band that criticizes systems of the American Government and its patriotism. They were one of the main influences on Serj Tankian to create music for System of the Down.</p>
        <p>As the commodification of Industrial Music has reached a point where many imitate only to create a product without the exploration of newer possibilities, meaning kills the very being of the sound. However, there are still artists who are so intimate with its sound that they'd compose music out of its stream. What emerges without being commodified is a sound horrified by the economy.</p>
        <p>Industrialization, post-humanism, and anarchism define my very nature of collectivism against controlled systems. Intimacy of humanity and freedom do not conflict; they are harmonious in the most dissonant sounds ever. That is why I want to express something, because there is a soul inside the fragmented and mechanical systems — they malfunction if I had no way to love.</p>

        <h2 class="title">“ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM” OF NOISE ROCK: SONIC YOUTH</h2>
        <div>
            <div class="image-case">

            </div>
            <p class="ref"><mark style="background-color: black; color: white;">Sonic Youth | 2005 | Karl Waters | Getty Images</mark></p>
        </div>
            <p>Dissonant, expressive, and rebellious; that’s what we associate with Noise Rock. Sonic Youth, as the prominent figure of the genre, translates this exact energy into youthful and indie styles of rock. Thurston Moore, the leading band member, mentions that his philosophical approach to music has always been “Abstract Expressionism.” </p>
            <p>When we hear “Abstract Expressionism” in a conversation, we think of Jackson Pollock. I first heard of him online, but he was mentioned in my Art Appreciation class — his approach to creating paintings is to record himself painting, which is what he calls “action painting.” I’ve composed a painting similar to his techniques of performing action painting, and the result is actually way different than how the majority of people perceive his works — it is the amalgamation of meanings collaged and deconstructed into a form of disfiguration. The brush strokes speak of something out of my comprehension, yet I feel that exact thing it is saying. A form of decentralized meanings speaks more than just one central meaning, and this enhances the actual message it conveys. Deconstruction is Thurston Moore’s philosophy, and radicalized expression was his method to communicate.</p>
            <p>When I tried to play or recreate a Sonic Youth song, I had so many concerns. Due to their use of very unusual alternative tunings such as “F#F#F#F#EB” in Teenage Riot, Kool Thing, and Shadow of a Doubt, which were undoubtedly some of their most popular and rated songs, and “EGDGED” in Sugar Kane and Dirty Boots, these tunings can easily break the strings because of its radical spin of loose strings to really tight strings — that is why they store hundreds of guitar set tuned when playing live shows. Their approach to music is dissonant and abrasive, which was radical for its time. However, it still functions as a classic 90s rock song.</p>
            <p>Steve Albini, a prominent and well-respected rock producer, is known for his work with most of the noise rock outfits. He was the producer and recording engineer of Nirvana, PJ Harvey, Unsane, Helmet, The Jesus Lizard, Slint, Jawbreaker, Don Caballero, Shellac, The Breeders, mclusky, and many more — being involved in some of my favorite musical outfits respected him as a musician. He was the staple of shaping the 90s rock sound, which we defined as angst and abrasive, as we think about the era. Before his work with these musical outfits, he was the leading member of the industrial noise rock band “Big Black.” They compose with a focus on discomfort and an intimate relationship with metallic noise; therefore, their radicalization comes with the transgressiveness of a sense of hearing.</p>
            <p>The danger of noise reminded me of that one film, “Sounds of Metal.” A drummer in a noise rock band suffers from hearing loss, and we see how his illness gradually leads to his descent mentally. As someone who dreads becoming deaf even with how loud I play with my guitar, I recognize that we have always loved to deviate from the masses and escape our own comfort zone — kicking asses ‘til midnight due, but is it really safe to escape? We always love to experiment and create new things, and yet we still need to worry about ourselves. To express our deepest needs is to sacrifice that very idea of ourselves, which is how creation becomes a part of ourselves, and yet it is still the most human thing to do. The most successful revolutions would never be calm; there will always be the dichotomy between the person and the system that’ll obstruct their control, so lose a leg and let the curtains roll.</p>

        <h2 class="title">JOHN ZORN & NO WAVE: <u>THE PUNKS WHO NEVER COMMODIFIED</u></h2>
        <p>As Noise Rock becomes mainstream, as such with Nirvana hitting its goal on the Billboard, we tend to ask ourselves: <blockquote>“Does becoming a successful punk, a contradiction of themselves?”</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>We remember the name “Vivienne Westwood,” a popular luxury fashion brand that costs a lot of money to buy their clothes; however, that wasn't her expected vision at all. In the mid-70s, Vivienne worked with Malcolm McLaren, her former husband and a manager for Sex Pistols. Vivienne Westwood started as a punk fashion business in which she created clothes in the <abbr title="Do-It-Yourself">DIY</abbr> fashion, which presents provocative graphics, deconstruction of design, and a rebellious tone, where her work defines fashion's counter-culture. In her success as a fashion designer, she turned from punk fashion to luxury, where she reformed her style towards “New Romantic”, which became a new trend of aesthetics in the 1980s. As her early punk designs became a commodity for companies to be a piggy-bank machine, this raises a phenomenon that is the ‘counter-culture anxiety’, which is relevant as a person who admires the punk culture.</p>
    <p>Mark Fisher, a renowned philosopher for his book “Capitalist Realism.” I’ve mentioned him in my previous blog due to his criticism of neoliberalism and its atrocious effect on human welfare, but he has also written an entire page dedicated to the situationists’ culture and its commodification under capitalist systems: <blockquote class="blockedquote"><mark style="background-color: black; color: white;">“The post-modern’s relationship with modernism conflicts with the very being of cultures, such as the detournments of the system were absorbed and commodified into a product — capitalism reduced these ideas into a frozen aesthetic and not as an ideal way of living.”</mark><br>
    -Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism</blockquote></p>
    <p>The ‘70s were the time when neoliberal capitalism started being promoted as the primary system of Western economics, heading its implementation by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher due to the success of the economist Milton Friedman. Neoliberalism took part in increasing gentrification and privatizing essential businesses for economic growth, which also involved sacrifices of social welfare.</p>
    <p>This oppressive system, rooted in economic destabilisation, caused punk to rise as a fundamental way of living. The anti-establishment, non-conformist, and pro-DIY culture invites an accumulation of people who are overfed with its very system to unite as a collective movement, and there's this one scene that solidifies the anti-commodification of music — that was No Wave.</p>
        <div class="image-case">

        </div>
            <p class="ref"><mark style="background-color: black; color: white;">DNA - DNA on DNA | 2004</mark></p>
    <p>Atonal, dissonant, defiant, visceral, and free form; an avant-garde music scene inspired from Free Jazz, Funk, Disco, Noise, Punk and Experimental Rock of the 70s which rejects the New Wave trend — it has the sonic of nihilism and angst in harsh soundscapes. Pioneered in New York’s underground music scene, by artists such as Suicide, Glenn Branca — an avant-garde musician who embraced No Wave as a form of Totalism — and No New York’s compilation release by Brian Eno that present bands such as Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, D.N.A., Mars, and Contortions. The scene directly refuses to be a product, but an ephemeral experience. Bands write songs and play radically without a proper musical structure — its deviance is formed and to be experienced empirically as a performance art.</p>
    <p>Due to the critical and negative reception of reviewers, how the sound was ultimately deconstructed and reduced to the fragmentation of punk and dance as a refusal of commercialization in the industry, the sound never entered the mainstream. However, remnants of the sound remain in various genres and artists such as Sonic Youth started as a No Wave band and was influenced in its radical tunings and composition, Swans who currently plays in an orchestral post-rock sound based on his musical experience of composing social critiques in an impenetrable sonic darkness of No Wave and Industrial’s mechanical abrasiveness, and the revival of the sound in late-2010s as black midi’s Schlagenheim became a success amongst Windmill Scene’s cult following — which gradually came into popularity due to internet’s accessibility and marketing with reviewers.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite music records of all time was DNA’s DNA on DNA compilation, released in 2004 and compiled the band’s songs recorded from 1978-1982, the sound was just as dissonant and faithful to their sound. These archives remain to be evidence of their existence while their music still lives in the shadow of others — hence, it was my dream to be a music archivist as I got older, music stores were my dream to build.</p>
    <p>John Zorn, an avant-garde jazz composer, keeps the spirit of No Wave and Grindcore to its highest degree. His musical compositions blend the styles of Free Jazz, Grindcore, Noise Rock, Drone Metal, Klezmer, Modern Classical and others while he still resists categorization and commercial success, although his work was popularized due to his connections and film features especially in the original and Hollywood remake of “Funny Games”, which fits the recurring theme of satire and insanity. His irrational compositions built my esteem in creating art — there are no rules to art if you don't want it, theories aren't rules but as tools to be conservative or to dismantle its very notion. We debate to create our own fractured systems as a sound collage of arguments, theories are destroyed to continuously flow in our social structure.</p>

            <p>In the book, “Anti-Oedipus” by Deleuze & Guattari, they created the concept of “body without organs” as a part of their schizoanalytical theories and nuclear family structure critique. Described as the pyramid which hides the potential of the unregulated bodies beyond the body of capital — the anarchic freedom that resists disciplinary control. While this is one of Deleuze & Guattari’s obscure yet ambiguous concepts, in the context and reinterpretation of art and politics — under capital labor, art is limited and regulated; therefore art becomes a gateway drug for people to deconstruct the system — John Zorn, No Wave, and any avant-garde artists dismantles it and becomes the heart itself, in fact, by human liberation is one specific way to obtain the heart of humanity back in our naturality. Through unregulated freedom, community, and empathy are the philosophies many and I adore in anarchism — bourgeois individuals would never own the world, but reciprocal tenderness of material condition.</p>

        <h2 class="title">ANARCHO-PUNKS, DISCIPLINE, AND EXISTENCE</h2>
        <p>As the media embraced the counter-culture and desired much wider appeal to the masses — what punks desired was only social solidarity, as wishes to be spoken through a voice louder than a siren. Anarcho-punk is a scene where anarchism and community, influenced by leftist ideologies, become the primary culture for punks and those who are disillusioned with the capitalist system. As anarchists deconstruct the basis of exploitative labor, parochial ignorance, discriminative oppression, and meritocracy’s competitive environment, anarcho-punks welcome all people through their cultural lifestyle as they live within their autonomous governance, and also participate in helping people who are oppressed, which means they value themselves and others, for they distinguish altruism as evil and collective freedom as solidarity of equality.</p>
        <div class="image-case">

        </div>
        <p class="ref"><mark style="background-color: black; color: white;">Crass | The Sound of Free Speech | Factory 25</mark></p>
        <p>Crass is one of the pioneers of the scene due to their experimental approach, activism, and strong socio-political message that resonates with most punks. They embedded the anarchist discipline into punk while bending multiple genres, which constructs the fundamental spirit of anarchism in punk. Their socio-politics became their signature as they promote the exact lifestyle they propose — that is, the freedom to speak, to live, and to act collectively. It is due to their passion for deconstructing social systems and hierarchies that they formed a lifestyle viable even living under capitalism. That passion for anarchism inspired many punk and hardcore bands, one of them being the Dead Kennedys, as they became the face of hardcore punk and the protest of dismantling unjust systems. The audience they would create for each live set is chaotic with mosh pits and some others watching, yet moshing is the ritual to ignite the fire of the burning spirit, thus moshing became prominent and the standard for all hardcore shows — symbolizing the chaotic freedom that many people and I have adored and dreamt of experiencing.</p>
        <p>Anarchism, in this era of the ‘80s, is becoming a turning alternative in Western culture, influencing different parts of the world. In the Philippines, much of punk rock in the West was imitated, but it inspired many artists to create distinct art in the language of the Filipinos. Lourd De Veyra is one of my favorite artists on Philippines, while his journalism is more well-known due to his grounded and unfiltered commentary — he maintained a status in the underground music scene and avant-garde art scene where he performs and composes jazz-fusion punk in a band named “Radioactive Sago Project” projecting a journalistic and historical spoken poetry and satire of the how Filipinos live under capitalism, its history, and how people cope under these circumstances. While he became a prominent figure in Filipino punk arts, he also led many discussions and raised many questions regarding the humanities, history, and government in the 2010s, due to his shows like “Word of the Lourd” or “Kontrabando”, including his TED Talks which gave me many insights about Filipino culture, even when it is deeply satirical yet serious.
    </p>
        <p>In our concurrent society, we as citizens experience many injustices and yet dispersed authority beyond our control, as experienced through the forces in Marcos and Duterte's presidential terms, where they controlled most of the government and responded to opposing teams with violence. We can define how this political phenomena in Philippine political governance as an hybrid system of disciplinary and control; Foucault defined “disciplinary societies” as the institutions that punishes non-conformists as the individual power of the head imposes surveillance and rules to keep the institution stabilized, then Deleuze defined “control societies” in the same token — only it is enclosed into the intrusion by networks and data. The government in this context can control how the media perceives them, and how discipline within institutions and social networks become instruments of unjust governments — we can already see this through how people via networks promote red-tagging and trolling as means to empower their beliefs, family cultures through “utang na loob”, crab mentality of the masses, cancel cultures, and many others that construct “only for disciplined people to enter social spaces.” 
    </p>
        <p>As a citizen, there are aspects of our law that don’t really make sense, as we don’t have anything to learn from it aside from limiting our perspective and liberty. As we analyze this through anarchist calisthenics, we can see how these laws and disciplines would shape us, people as ‘civilized’, but there’s nothing that could actually define our lives if the only way to live is to be obedient. We are always independent, as we were born as ‘blank slates’, which means we weren’t born as someone already, but a starting point to empirically develop ourselves. Every form of rebellion and revolution starts as we want to pursue something, with the intention of learning and developing our intrinsic senses, only we’d sacrifice obedience and result in finding a new kind of love. Rebellion is a way to create art and love, for such existence is a ballad of living. Albert Camus, in “The Rebel,” discusses this very notion:
        <blockquote class="blockedquote"><mark class="quote">“Everyone tries to make his life a work of art. We want love to last and we know that it does not last; even if, by some miracle, it were to last a whole lifetime, it would still be incomplete. Perhaps, in this insatiable need for perpetuation, we should better understand human suffering, if we knew that it was eternal. It appears that great minds are, sometimes, less horrified by suffering than by the fact that it does not endure. In default of inexhaustible happiness, eternal suffering would at least give us a destiny. But we do not even have that consolation, and our worst agonies come to an end one day. One morning, after many dark nights of despair, an irrepressible longing to live will announce to us the fact that all is finished and that suffering has no more meaning than happiness.” </mark><br>
    -Albert Camus, The Rebel</blockquote></p>
    <p>A human with a heart to create, from the suffering we endure. The chaotic star deviates from falling into the abyss of waves; a disaster is inevitable when we pursue and collapse, but happiness is attained through the rebellious love — anarchism is a poetry without borders, by a passionate and absurd human.</p>

            <p>Anarchism is ontological, and artists are its philosophers. Decentralize and be loved by keeping you free, while it is flawed — it is the human part that keeps you awake. Literature that defined our humanity; arts that enlighten humanity; everything that deviates from the sea is the immanence of independence. However, the systematic repercussions of capitalism oppress the welfare of the people. When authority becomes abusive, we’ll face suffering.

            <p>Society will impose ostracization of the outcasts and commodify their very beings into a product of capital. Bodies remain simulated, regulated, and surveilled by external forces. We live inside digital spaces, and our images are ingrained, becoming commodities for the system. As humans, we are to govern ourselves in our daily lives where we are the rules, as we think about the philosophy of nature — we are social creatures, and individual capitalism destroys that ability to rule and love in exchange for market value.<blockquote class="blockedquote"><mark style="background-color: black; color: white;">“The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital.”</mark><br>-Murray Bookchin</blockquote></p>
